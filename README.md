# Tour of Data Structures

<blockquote>
This repository is intended to hold implementations of various data structures.

I've taken the standard university computer science classes which teach data
structures, but, with the goal of continuing my education, I intend to research and implement
data structures and algorithms in various programming languages.
I plan on starting with the basic, well-known data structures and eventually
move to lesser-known ones.
**My tentative todo list so far is:**
* Node
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queues
* Set
* Trees
* Heaps
* Hashes
* Various Graphs
* Treap
* Suffix Array
* Kinetic Data Structures
